<p>Floodwater Depth Estimation Tool (FwDET) v2.1 after Cohen et al. (2022) [doi:10.3390/rs14215313]. Calculates floodwater depths using a digital elevation model (DEM) and a flood extent polygon. This algorithm was ported from ArcPy and therefore may behave differently from the original.</p>
        
<h3>Tips and Tricks</h3>
Try removing small holes ('Delete Holes') and islands (select by feature size and delete) from your inundation polygon.
Read the log warnings carefully.
If the tool is very slow, try running 'Simplify' on the inundation polygon first or dividing the domain.
For geographic CRS, try r.grow.distance metric = euclidean.

<h3>Algorithm steps</h3>
1) Clip and pre-check.
2) Compute the shore/boundary pixels (filtering, smoothing, etc.).
3) Grow/extend the shore/boundary pixels onto the full domain using <a href="https://grass.osgeo.org/grass82/manuals/r.grow.distance.html">r.grow.distance</a>.
4) Clip and subtract with DEM to compute depths.
5) Apply low-pass filter.
